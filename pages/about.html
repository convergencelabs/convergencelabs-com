      <div class="col-md-8 motivation">
        <p>At Convergence Labs we believe that much of today's software <i>should</i> provide a <strong>real time collaboration</strong> user experience; more and more users are agreeing with us. A common request in message boards and customer support systems is to add real time collaboration. Real time collaboration seems to be on everyone's "road map". Why then, isn't all software providing real time collaboration already?</p>
        <p>It turns out that building real time collaboration is <strong>HARD</strong> and multi-faceted. To implement successful collaborative systems requires mastery of concurrency control, distributed systems, cognitive science, collaborative UI/UX, and experience building effective collaborative workflows based on unique use cases.  Building an effective collaborative system usually involves integrating many technologies each of which are complex on their own, let alone when implemented together. What's more, there are a lot of "real time" technologies out there. Knowing which of them will work well and scale for a particular use case requires in depth experience. Finally, many of the commercial and open source User Interface toolkits (text editors, etc.) simply were not built with collaboration in mind and lack APIs required to easily support collaboration. These road blocks are the primary reason much of today's software is not collaborative.</p>
        <p>Many of our clients have started down the path to real time collaboration only to find that it is to difficult and ultimately abandon the project. These challenges are holding back the "real time revolution". We started Convergence Labs specifically to help developers achieve success in building real time collaboration in to their applications. We are dedicated to building awesome applications that provide exquisite real time collaboration experiences. Whether we are building the whole app, or just brought in to build out the collaboration portions, we can help take your app to the next level and provide you with a valuable differentiators over your competition.</p>
        <p>At the same time we are working on a Real Time Collaboration platform simply called Convergence, that will allow <strong>all</strong> developers to rapidly develop and deploy great collaborative applications. We've used convergence internally to build awesome collaborative apps, and will soon be opening up the platform for other developers as well. Simply put our goals are to 1) help our customers move real time collaboration from their road map to reality, 2) provide tools that help other developers implement collaborative apps, and 3) educated the software development community on patterns and practices for effective real time collaboration development. </p>
