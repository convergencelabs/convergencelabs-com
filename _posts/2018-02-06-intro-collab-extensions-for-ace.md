Build a multi-user code editor in minutes, with Ace and Convergence Labs' Ace Collaborative Extensions. 
<!--excerpt-->
The [Ace Code Editor](https://ace.c9.io/) has been the web's premiere code editor for some time now, with a huge community behind it and far-reaching usage across the web. Notably, it helps millions of developers at [GitHub](https://github.com/blog/905-edit-like-an-ace) and [Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9) navigate and edit code in a very user-friendly fashion.  

(discuss how Aceâ€™s original implementation of multiple cursors/selections was insufficient, and why we felt we needed to build it)
