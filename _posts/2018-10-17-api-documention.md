Find our API Documentation here: <https://docs.convergence.io/js-api/>

Or, if you're new to Convergence, start here: <https://docs.convergence.io/guide/>

### A bit of history
We actually wanted to release API documentation _before_ the developer guide, but the tools at the time weren't quite up to par.  The Javascript client is written in Typescript (which we highly recommend), and as a small startup, we didn't have the bandwidth to roll our own documentation from scratch.  But thanks to steady improvements in the [TypeDoc](http://typedoc.org/) project, we could generate docs from our source code with an acceptable level of quality.  

### Looking forward
We realize there is still a _lot_ to do per the depth of documentation for our various classes and methods, as well as general organization.  But, most importantly, you can now get answers to questions like _what is the name of that event?_ and _what methods are actually on that service?_  We'll be fleshing out the documentation over the next few months: it's thankless work, but somebody's got to do it!

Enjoy, and thanks for bearing with us.  Happy hacking!
