Hot on the heels of our significant [1.0.0-rc.4 release](/blog/2020/01/convergence-1-0-0-rc4/), we are pleased to announce the availability of [1.0.0-rc.5](https://github.com/convergencelabs/convergence-project/wiki/CHANGELOG#100-rc5-jan-19-2020). Release Candidate 4 got a lot of attention and had a lot of new features. Lots of users got their hands on that release and gave us quite a bit of feedback.  Release Candidate 5 is packed with 29 bug fixes and features prioritized by you, our community.

Release Candidate 5 sees a continued emphasis on open sourcing and public artifact availability. We continue to migrate more code to GitHub, publish more artifacts in public repositories, and host public builds on Travis.

## Release Highlights:
Release Candidate 5 focuses mainly on:

* Bug fixes for the recently-released [offline support](/blog/2020/01/new-features-offline-support-and-connection-smoothing/).
* Several fixes and improvements for the [Admin Web Console](https://github.com/convergencelabs/convergence-admin-console).
* Several fixes and improvements for the Chat subsystem.
* A new ability to query models by model id.
* Open sourcing of more pieces of Convergence on GitHub.
* Publishing additional artifacts to Maven Central.

## What's Next?
Check our road map [Here](https://github.com/convergencelabs/convergence-project/wiki/Convergence-Road-Map) to see what we are focusing on in general.  In the short term we'll be working on:

* More bug fixes.
* More open sourcing.
* The design and implementation of our [Experimental Rich Text Support](https://github.com/convergencelabs/convergence-project/issues/37).

Happy coding!
