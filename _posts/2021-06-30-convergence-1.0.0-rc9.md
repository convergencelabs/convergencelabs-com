The Convergence team is pleased to announce the availability of 1.0.0-rc.9. This was a pretty major effort accomplished in a pretty short amount of time. Community participation has seen an increase over the last several months and has driven quite a bit of rapid improvement. We are excited to bring you this release and to get right to work on the next one!

You can read about the release over at the [Convergence Product Website](https://convergence.io/news/2021/06/convergence-1-0-0-rc9/) or you can head
