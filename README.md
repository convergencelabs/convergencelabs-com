## Cross-posting to Medium 
We're using a customized version of the [`jekyll-crosspost-to-medium`](https://github.com/aarongustafson/jekyll-crosspost-to-medium) plugin.

To execute the cross-post:
1. Get your medium integration token from your [settings](https://medium.com/me/settings).
1. Set a couple environment variables:
   ```
   export MEDIUM_USER_ID=8214ea30605c
   export MEDIUM_INTEGRATION_TOKEN=<token>
   ```
1. Add `crosspost_to_medium: true` to the post header
1. Do a `jekyll build`. The plugin automatically keeps track of what is has posted in a `.jekyll-crosspost_to_medium` directory.
